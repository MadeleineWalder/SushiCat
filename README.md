### Validator Testing

- I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to test my html. The results showed several errors which I then fixed, resulting in 0 errors.

HTML validation after errors fixed:

- I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to test my CSS. There were a couple of minor errors which were easy to fix, resulting in 0 errors.

## Deployment:

### Gitpod

- Typing 'python3 -m http.server' into the Gitpod terminal allows you to view the site in a browser as if it were live
- Every time a secton of code is added the browser can be refreshed to see the change, sometimes you need to press ctrl, shift and R at the same time for changes to be updated
- To save and commit progress, type 'git add .' into the terminal to add all your changes followed by 'git commit -m' and then your message describing what you did in double quotes
- Typing 'git push' will then push your code, and this should be done at the end of every coding session or whenever you want an already deployed site to be updated


### Github and Github Pages

- To deploy my site I first went to Github and found my project repository on the left hand side and clicked it
- I then clicked on 'Settings' and then the 'Pages' option on the left   
- Here I changed the branch from 'none' to 'main'
- Finally I clicked save and after a short while it produced a link to my deployed site
