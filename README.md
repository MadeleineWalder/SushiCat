Notes:
Why do I have Cloudiinary? It's not being used for anything. Uninstall?

building admin site pt1
created and migrated booking model
created superuser
run server with /admin and logged in as superuser
added test booking
seems like it already has full CRUD functionality, must be part of the django built in library
stopped server for now

building admin site pt2
dont think I need a slug field
since it already has CRUD I dont think I need a separate class for edit ans delete
if I did add these or any models to models.py, they must also be imported to admin.py so you can see them when logged in
